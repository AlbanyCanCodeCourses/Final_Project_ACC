# Final_Project_ACC

Final project for Albany Can Code

This project was build with webpack.  I did not include my api key because I was taught not to do that at ACC.  
Keys would go in "./keys/keys.js".  All HTML strings and user input are santized with DOMPurify. This app will display the top 
20 most popular movies by genre and also allows the user to search for movies on TMDB via asynchronous calls to their API and displays information on each Movie to the user in containers.
